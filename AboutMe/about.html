            <p class="section-paragraph">
                My coursework includes High Energy Astrophysics, Galaxy Astronomy, Observational Astrophysics, Stellar Physics, Astrometry and Celestial Mechanics, Basic Astronomy, Planetary Remote Sensing and Spectroscopy, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Theoretical Mechanics, Mathematical Physics Methods, and Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics.
            </p>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                I have passed CET-4 with a score of 599 and CET-6 with a score of 493. I have extensive experience reading English literature and have independently completed an English paper.
            </p>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C, C#, and IDL, and familiarity with software like LaTeX, Origin, ENVI, and ArcGIS. I have received multiple scholarships and awards, including the National Astronomical Observatories Scholarship, Academic Third-Class Scholarship (twice), Specialty Scholarship (Research Innovation, twice), Advanced Individual in Club Activities (2022), and Advanced Individual in School Innovation and Entrepreneurship Activities (2024).

                <ul>
                    <li>Searching for large samples of multi-band photometric images of various types of galaxies (merging galaxies, elliptical galaxies, spiral/barred spiral galaxies, Edge-On galaxies) and constructing a multi-type galaxy photometric image dataset suitable for machine learning, including training, testing, and validation sets.</li>
                    <li>Developing a model to distinguish merging galaxies using a hybrid machine learning method (neural network feature extraction and support vector machine classification), and optimizing the algorithm and model architecture to achieve high performance.</li>
                    <li>Compiling the research into a paper for submission to a journal.</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="section-paragraph1">
                <strong>May 2022 - May 2023:</strong> <em>Observational Study of Galaxy Evolution Along Merger Sequence: Gas, Star Formation, and Nuclear Activity</em> (Core Member). My work involved searching for multi-band photometric data (SDSS-2MASS-Herschel) of Herschel KPAIRS samples, using CIGALE and MAGPHYS for SED fitting and stellar population decomposition, and statistically analyzing parameters such as gas content, galaxy mass, and age at different stages of evolution and in different components of merging galaxies.
            </p>
            <p class="section-paragraph2">
                <strong>October 2021 - May 2022:</strong> <em>Remote Sensing Mineralogy Study of Young Lunar Basalts</em> (Member). I participated in searching for coordinates, diameters, and frequency data of impact craters in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the Moon and identifying visible-near-infrared spectra of materials in this region.

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are compact regions at the center of galaxies that are incredibly luminous across a wide range of wavelengths, including radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The energy output of AGN is primarily due to accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Luminosity:</strong> AGNs can outshine the combined light of all the stars in the host galaxy.</li>
            <li><strong>Broad Emission Lines:</strong> The spectra of AGNs show broad emission lines, indicating the presence of fast-moving gas close to the black hole.</li>
            <li><strong>Variability:</strong> AGNs exhibit variability in their light output over various timescales, from hours to years.</li>
            <li><strong>Jets and Outflows:</strong> Some AGNs produce powerful jets of relativistic particles, which can extend far beyond the host galaxy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Models</h2>
        <p>Several models have been proposed to explain the nature and behavior of AGNs. The most widely accepted model involves a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk of infalling material. This material heats up due to friction and gravitational forces, emitting vast amounts of radiation.</p>
        <h3>Unified Model</h3>
        <p>The unified model of AGN suggests that different types of AGNs (such as Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and radio galaxies) are fundamentally the same objects viewed from different angles. The differences in observed properties are mainly due to the orientation of the AGN's central engine relative to our line of sight.</p>
        <h3>Radiatively Efficient vs. Inefficient Models</h3>
        <p>AGN can be classified based on the efficiency with which they convert infalling matter into radiation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Radiatively Efficient AGNs:</strong> These include quasars and Seyfert galaxies, where the accretion process is highly efficient in converting mass into energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Radiatively Inefficient AGNs:</strong> Such as low-luminosity AGNs, where the accretion process is less efficient, possibly due to a lower rate of mass infall or different physical processes in the accretion disk.</li>
        </ul>
